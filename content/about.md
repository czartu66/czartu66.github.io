Hi 👋🏻  I'm Adam, a graduate ICT student and currently employed as a Quality Assurance Engineer. I have over three years of experience in Python programming and QA/Test Automation. My current goal is to enhance my coding skills and delve into web application development. In my free time, I enjoy producing music.

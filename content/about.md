Hi, 👋🏻  

My name is Adam, a graduate ICT student and currently a Quality Assurance Engineer. 
I have over three years of experience in Python programming and QA/Test Automation. 
My current goal is to enhance my coding skills, delve into web application development and increase my knowledge and experience with Data Science/ML. 

In my free time, I enjoy producing music and DJing 🎧
